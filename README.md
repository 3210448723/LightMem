## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All behaviors of LightMem are controlled via the BaseMemoryConfigs configuration class. Users can customize aspects like pre-processing, memory extraction, retrieval strategy, and update mechanisms by providing a custom configuration.
#### Key Configuration Options (Usage)

| Option                    | Default                                     | Usage (allowed values and behavior) |
| :---                      | :---                                        | :--- |
| `pre_compress`        | `False`                                     | True / False. If True, input messages are pre-compressed using the `pre_compressor` configuration before being stored. This reduces storage and indexing cost but may remove fine-grained details. If False, messages are stored without pre-compression. |
| `pre_compressor`      | `None`                                      | dict / object. Configuration for the pre-compression component (`PreCompressorConfig`) with fields like `model_name` (e.g., `llmlingua-2`, `entropy_compress`) and `configs` (model-specific parameters). Effective only when `pre_compress=True`. |
| `topic_segment`       | `False`                                     | True / False. Enables topic-based segmentation of long conversations. When True, long conversations are split into topic segments and each segment can be indexed/stored independently (requires `topic_segmenter`). When False, messages are stored sequentially. |
| `precomp_topic_shared`| `False`                                     | True / False. If True, pre-compression and topic segmentation can share intermediate results to avoid redundant processing. May improve performance but requires careful configuration to avoid cross-topic leakage. |
| `topic_segmenter`     | `None`                                      | dict / object. Configuration for topic segmentation (`TopicSegmenterConfig`), including `model_name` and `configs` (segment length, overlap, etc.). Used when `topic_segment=True`. |
| `messages_use`        | `'user_only'`                               | `'user_only'` / `'assistant_only'` / `'hybrid'`. Controls which messages are used to generate metadata and summaries: `user_only` uses user inputs, `assistant_only` uses assistant responses, `hybrid` uses both. Choosing `hybrid` increases processing but yields richer context. |
| `metadata_generate`   | `True`                                      | True / False. If True, metadata such as keywords and entities are extracted and stored to support attribute-based and filtered retrieval. If False, no metadata extraction occurs. |
| `text_summary`        | `True`                                      | True / False. If True, a text summary is generated and stored alongside the original text (reduces retrieval cost and speeds review). If False, only the original text is stored. Summary quality depends on `memory_manager`. |
| `memory_manager`      | `MemoryManagerConfig()`                     | dict / object. Controls the model used to generate summaries and metadata (`MemoryManagerConfig`), e.g., `model_name` (`openai`, `deepseek`) and `configs`. Changing this affects summary style, length, and cost. |
| `extract_threshold`   | `0.5`                                       | float (0.0 - 1.0). Threshold used to decide whether content is important enough to be extracted as metadata or highlight. Higher values (e.g., 0.8) mean more conservative extraction; lower values (e.g., 0.2) extract more items (may increase noise). |
| `index_strategy`      | `None`                                      | `'embedding'` / `'context'` / `'hybrid'` / `None`. Determines how memories are indexed: 'embedding' uses vector-based indexing (requires embedders/retriever) for semantic search; 'context' uses text-based/contextual retrieval (requires context_retriever) for keyword/document similarity; and 'hybrid' combines context filtering and vector reranking for robustness and higher accuracy.
| `text_embedder`       | `None`                                      | dict / object. Configuration for text embedding model (`TextEmbedderConfig`) with `model_name` (e.g., `huggingface`) and `configs` (batch size, device, embedding dim). Required when `index_strategy` or `retrieve_strategy` includes `'embedding'`. |
| `multimodal_embedder` | `None`                                      | dict / object. Configuration for multimodal/image embedder (`MMEmbedderConfig`). Used for non-text modalities. |
| `history_db_path`     | `os.path.join(lightmem_dir, "history.db")`  | str. Path to persist conversation history and lightweight state. Useful to restore state across restarts. |
| `retrieve_strategy`   | `'embedding'`                               | `'embedding'` / `'context'` / `'hybrid'`. Strategy used at query time to fetch relevant memories. Pick based on data and query type: semantic queries -> `'embedding'`; keyword/structured queries -> `'context'`; mixed -> `'hybrid'`. |
| `context_retriever`   | `None`                                      | dict / object. Configuration for context-based retriever (`ContextRetrieverConfig`), e.g., `model_name='BM25'` and `configs` like `top_k`. Used when `retrieve_strategy` includes `'context'`. |
| `embedding_retriever` | `None`                                      | dict / object. Vector store configuration (`EmbeddingRetrieverConfig`), e.g., `model_name='qdrant'` and connection/index params. Used when `retrieve_strategy` includes `'embedding'`. |
| `update`              | `'offline'`                                 | `'online'` / `'offline'`. `'online'`: update memories immediately after each interaction (low latency for fresh memories but higher operational cost). `'offline'`: batch or scheduled updates to save cost and aggregate changes. |
| `kv_cache`            | `False`                                     | True / False. If True, attempt to precompute and persist model KV caches to accelerate repeated LLM calls (requires support from the LLM runtime and may increase storage). Uses `kv_cache_path` to store cache. |
| `kv_cache_path`       | `os.path.join(lightmem_dir, "kv_cache.db")` | str. File path for KV cache storage when `kv_cache=True`. |
| `graph_mem`           | `False`                                     | True / False. When True, some memories will be organized as a graph (nodes and relationships) to support complex relation queries and reasoning. Requires additional graph processing/storage. |
| `version`             | `'v1.1'`                                    | str. Configuration/API version. Only change if you know compatibility implications. |
